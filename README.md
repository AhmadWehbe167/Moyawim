# Moyawim
A Flutter mobile application that links local workers with employers.

I was responsible for most of the backend and some of the frontened.
I worked in a team of 4 members on this project. We were trying to apply
agile process for development. We had scrum meeting every working day to discuss
our progress.

I learned flutter and firebase in a relatively short time while I was studying for
5 courses in the University. I learned it through an online course on Udemy and get
better through practice.

We have learned a lot through this project, but the main problem was that we didn't use
git and github. Thus, collaborating and working together as a team was harder.

# Moyawim
A Flutter mobile application that links local workers with employers.

I was responsible for most of the backend and some pages for the frontened.
I worked in a team of 4 members on this project. We were trying to apply
agile process for development. We had scrum meeting every working day to discuss
our progress.

I learned flutter and firebase in a relatively short time while I was studying for
5 courses in the University.
